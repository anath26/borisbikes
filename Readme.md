# Welcome to the Boris Bikes Rental System!

This is a sample exercise to help you hone your [Object Oriented Programming](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ObjectOrientedProgramming) skills as part of the course I am giving at [Makers Academy](http://makersacademy.com) this April (2013).

The aim is to recreate the rental system for the famous 'Boris Bikes' in London.

## What do we know

- People can go to a docking station and rent a bike
- They can also return bikes to a docking station
- A docking station has a number of bikes it can hold
- Some bikes can be broken and will not be available for rental
- Bikes can be returned to any docking station
- When a broken bike is returned that bike cannot be rented
- There are vans from a garage that pickup broken bikes from the docking station and deliver them to the garage for repairing
- Every van has one or more docking stations assigned
- The bikes are repaired in the garage
- A van can deliver repaired bikes to a docking station

## What do you have to do?

Model the domain so that the objects can interact to recreate this scenarios.

## How?
